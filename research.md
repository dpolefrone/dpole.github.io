# Research

Broadly, I'm excited about designing accessible, intuitive tools and platforms to enhance the synergy between human chemical intuition and computational advances. Much of my graduate research has centered on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) instrumentation, although my early exposure to organic chemistry as an undergraduate mostly focused on applications of density functional theory (DFT) to investigate mechanistic pathways for catalytic reactions.

After ~2.5 years in the group of Dr. Marisa Kozlowski at Penn, during which time I was awarded a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP), I work in the new group of Dr. Andrew Zahrt. 

During working hours, I can usually be found on the second floor of the Chemistry Complex (1973 Wing). 

Here are some themes and techniques that I currently work on:
