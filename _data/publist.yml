  description: Herein, we present a novel approach to complex reaction analysis utilizing partial deuterium labels which enables direct product identification via liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry. When combined with spectral deconvolution, the method generates product ratios while circumventing chromatography altogether. Competitive kinetic isotope effects can also be determined.
